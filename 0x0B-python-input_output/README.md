- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3` exactly
- A `README.md` file at the root of your project directory is mandatory
- Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules, classes, and functions (inside and outside classes) should have documentation

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder called `tests`
- All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don't miss any edge cases
