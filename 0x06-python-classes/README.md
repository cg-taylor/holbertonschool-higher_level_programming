0x06. Python - Classes

This project introduces object oriented programming (OOP) to the students at Holberton for the first time.

## Learning Objectives
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is OOP
- "first-class everything"
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected, and private attributes
- What is `self`
- What is a method
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
- What are Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes
- What is and what does contain `__dict__` of a class and of an instance of a class
- How does Python find attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

## General Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All of your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- All of your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3` exactly
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested with `wc`
- All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and ouside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

## Files
0-square.py:
	Write an empty class `Square` that defines a square

1-square.py:
	Give the class in task 0 a private instance attribute `size`

2-square.py:
	Instantiate the attribute defined in task 1 with exception handling using `__init__`

3-square.py:
	Add a public instance method to the class `Square` called `area()`

4-square.py:
	Define a getter and setter for `size`

5-square.py:
	Print the square using `#` to stdout

6-square.py:
	Create a private attribute `position` with a getter and setter and add the attribute to the instantiation
