0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project introduces two new variable types: lists and tuples. The project tasks cover a variety of different manipulations of lists and tuples as well as a single C program involving singly linked lists.

## Learning Objectives
* Why Python programming is awesome
* What are lists and how to use them
* What are the similarities and differences between strings and lists
* What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
* How to use lists as stacks and gueues
* What are list comprehensions and how to use them
* What are tuples and how to use them
* When to use tuples vs lists
* What is a sequence
* What is tuple packing
* What is sequence unpacking
* What is the `del` statement and how to use it


## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files should end with a newline
* A README.md file at the root of the project directory is required
* All your files will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Python Scripts
* The first line of all of your files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3` exactly
* Use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

### C
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* You do not need to push any `main.c` files to your repo. We will use our own `main.c` files to test your code
* Include all prototypes in a header file called `lists.h`. Don't forget to push it!
* All header files should be include guarded
